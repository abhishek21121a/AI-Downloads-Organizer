✅ Ensure Proper Formatting in GitHub
Open README.md in a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, or GitHub itself).

Check for missing spaces or incorrect line breaks. Markdown needs proper spacing for headings, lists, and code blocks.

Ensure your file is saved with UTF-8 encoding (default in most editors).

Manually format it with extra spaces if needed. For example:

Headings: Add a space after #
md
Copy
Edit
# AI Downloads Organizer
Lists: Ensure lists have a space after - or *
md
Copy
Edit
- Feature 1  
- Feature 2  
Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (```) before and after code.
✅ Force GitHub to Refresh Rendering
Commit and Push the changes again:
sh
Copy
Edit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated README formatting"
git push origin main
Clear Cache: If changes are not reflecting, try refreshing the page using Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac).
✅ Alternative: Edit README Directly on GitHub
If local formatting issues persist:

Go to your GitHub Repository
Click on README.md
Click the Pencil (Edit) icon
Manually adjust spaces and line breaks
Click Commit Changes
